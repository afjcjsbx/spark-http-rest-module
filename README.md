# Sparkttp

This is a library for performing REST HTTP calls within an Apache Spark application. It can be used to interact with web APIs from Spark, enabling data fetching and processing from external sources.


## Installation

To install the library, download the JAR file from the release section of our GitHub repository and include it in your Spark project.

If you are using sbt, you can add the following dependency to your build.sbt file:

```makefile
libraryDependencies += "com.example" %% "library-name" % "version"
```

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use our library to make a GET call to a web API:


```scala
```

You can then use the response to create a Spark DataFrame:

```scala
```

The library supports GET, POST, DELETE, and PUT requests. See the API documentation for more details.
